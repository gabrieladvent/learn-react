# Learn React + Vite

This repository is my repository for learning 'plek ketiplek' from the [VIP CODE STUDIO](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmF_zPV9ZcP346sttD4Vs2VROLlIp5kPz&si=evPKF6a_rsJP-lTV) youtube channel.

disclaimer: this is a repository of 'plek ketiplek' results so don't expect me to learn much. Maybe in the future there will be further projects related to react js, but maybe there is.
